# T-5: Render Performance Audit

## Goal
Identify and document performance bottlenecks in the rendering subsystem of the simulator without affecting robot behavior logic.

## Tasks
- [x] Measure current FPS and frame time variability during typical simulation runs.
- [x] Profile rendering calls in `main.js` (requestAnimationFrame, canvas drawing).
- [x] Check for redundant redraws or expensive DOM operations in `index.html` and `styles.css`.
- [x] Document specific bottlenecks and propose optimizations in `AUDIT.md`.
- [x] Verify that simulation physics and robot logic remain untouched during profiling (Proof of No Change).

## Acceptance
- [x] Performance report with identified bottlenecks is ready.
- [x] Profiling data for baseline and high-load scenarios is collected.
- [x] Proposed optimizations do not involve changes to `robot.js` or `firmware.js`.

## Proof of No Change
- No changes to `robot.js`, `firmware.js`, or `robot` state logic in `main.js`.
- All behavior-related tests (if any) pass.
- Public interfaces and simulation constants remain identical.
