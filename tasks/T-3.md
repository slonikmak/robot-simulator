# Task T-3: Add 20x10m rectangular room walls

Goal: Define 4 walls to enclose the simulation world in a 20x10m rectangle.

Plan:
- [x] Remove current singular bottom wall from `OBSTACLES` in `main.js`.
- [x] Define 4 `RectObstacle` instances in `OBSTACLES` array:
    - Top wall: centered at (0, -5), width 20, thickness 0.12
    - Bottom wall: centered at (0, 5), width 20, thickness 0.12
    - Left wall: centered at (-10, 0), width 0.12, height 10
    - Right wall: centered at (10, 0), width 0.12, height 10
- [x] Update `CFG` if needed to reflect the new room dimensions (e.g., world limits).
- [x] Verify that the robot and zone are still correctly positioned within the walls.

Acceptance:
- The simulation shows 4 walls forming a 20x10m rectangle.
- The robot cannot move through these walls (collision detection should work automatically via `OBSTACLES` and `rayIntersectAABB`).
- The ultrasonic sensor correctly detects these walls.

Proof of no regression:
- No changes to robot physics or sensor logic beyond constants and environment definition.
- Manual check: ensure the zone (radius 2m) is well within the 10m height and 20m width.
